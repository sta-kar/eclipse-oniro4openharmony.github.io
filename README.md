# Oniro Documentation

Welcome to the Oniro Project documentation repository. This repository hosts the documentation for the Oniro Project, an Eclipse Foundation initiative dedicated to developing an open-source, vendor-neutral Operating System (OS) platform. Oniro builds upon OpenHarmony, extending its capabilities to provide a versatile platform for smart devices across various industries.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and uses the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and follows a structured approach to provide clear and accessible guidance for Oniro developers.

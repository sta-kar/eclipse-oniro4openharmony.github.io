### Overview

Before you can implement modular architecture in your application, you need to set up a project that supports module development. This section guides you through creating a new project from scratch and understanding its structure.

**1.** Choose `Empty Ability` as project template and proceed.

**2.** In this tutorial we will separate modules for `wearable` and `mobile` applications. Make sure you have selected `Phone` and `Wearable` in the `Device type` section.

In the current project, right-click the project name, select `New`, and then choose Module.

By default, there are two shared package templates available: one for dynamic shared packages and one for static shared packages, as shown in the figure below.

</div> 


Set the shared-package name and click **Finish**. This tutorial uses `Shared Library`.

After the dynamic shared package is created, its structure is shown below, with the **type** set to `shared`.
For a static shared package, **type** is set to `har`.

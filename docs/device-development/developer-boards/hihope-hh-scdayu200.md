# HiHope HH-SCDAYU200 Development Kit

## Introduction
Based on the Rockchip RK3568, this development kit integrates advanced features
such as a dual-core architecture GPU and a high-performance NPU. Complemented by 
an onboard quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A55 processor which has a frequency of up to 2.0GHz, 
it ensures robust performance.

The rich set of peripherals ranges from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to audio, video,
camera and a variety of Bosch Sensortec sensors.

The expansion board offers rich expansion interfaces, and supports a variety
of video input and output interfaces suited for applications with rich user
interface requirements.

It is also equipped with dual Gigabit adaptive RJ45 Ethernet ports, which can
meet the needs of NVR, industrial gateway and other multi-network port products.

## Building

To build Eclipse Oniro for this board the normal [quick build](../building-oniro.md)
procedure has to be used to fetch the needed source code and environment.

During the build step, inside the Docker instance, the target device for the
build has to be set to **rk3568**.

```bash
./build.sh --product-name rk3568 --ccache
```

## Flashing

To begin, connect the board to your computer as outlined in [the HiHope DAYU200 documentation](https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs/blob/master/HiHope_DAYU200/docs/%E7%83%A7%E5%BD%95%E6%8C%87%E5%AF%BC%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3.md). Use the USB-C and mini-USB cables included in the kit to connect to the USB 3.0 OTG port and the mini-USB DEBUG port, respectively.

We have different steps for a standalone Linux system and for Windows systems with built-in WSL.

- [Standalone Linux System](#in-standalone-linux-system)  
- [Windows System with built-in WSL](#windows-system-with-built-in-wsl)  

### In Standalone Linux System

Power on the device by attaching the power cable. Upon successful connection, your serial console should display output similar to:

```bash
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 2207:5000 Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Company "HDC Device"
...
Bus 001 Device 069: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
```

Download the `flash.py` flashing tool from [Gitee](https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs/tree/master/HiHope_DAYU200/%E7%83%A7%E5%86%99%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E5%8F%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/linux) using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs.git hihope_iot_docs
mkdir flash && cp -r hihope_iot_docs/HiHope_DAYU200/烧写工具及指南/linux/* flash/
chmod +x flash/flash.py flash/bin/flash.x86_64
```

To ensure proper device recognition, install the `udev` rule:

```bash
sudo cp flash/etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules
```
Then, either reload udev rules or reboot your system:

```bash
udevadm control --reload-rules
```

After this setup, running `flash/flash.py -q` should produce the following output, indicating readiness:

```bash
maskrom
```

To enable *programming mode* on the device, perform the following steps:

 1. Press and hold `VOL/RECOVERY` then `RESET` buttons.
 2. Release `RESET` button.

Confirm the mode by running `lsusb`, which should show:

```bash
...
Bus 001 Device 070: ID 2207:350a Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Company USB download gadget
...

$ flash/flash.py -q
loader
```

Once the above steps are completed successfully, you can proceed to flash the board:

```bash
flash/flash.py -a -i ./out/rk3568/packages/phone/images
```

#### Connecting to serial console

To read the serial output, ensure the board is correctly connected and powered on. The default baud rate for the HH-SCDAYU200 board is 1500000. You can use minicom or a similar serial terminal:

```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000
```

### Windows System with built-in WSL
Power on the device by attaching the power cable. Upon successful connection, type `lsusb` on **WSL** your serial console will display output similar to:

```bash
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
```
It's not connected yet, but don't worry.

Download the `flash.py` flashing tool from [Gitee](https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs/tree/master/HiHope_DAYU200/%E7%83%A7%E5%86%99%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E5%8F%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/linux) using the following commands on your **WSL**:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/hihope_iot/docs.git hihope_iot_docs
mkdir flash && cp -r hihope_iot_docs/HiHope_DAYU200/烧写工具及指南/linux/* flash/
chmod +x flash/flash.py flash/bin/flash.x86_64
```

To ensure proper device recognition, install the `udev` rule:

```bash
sudo cp flash/etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/85-rk3568.rules
```
Then, either reload udev rules or reboot your system:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Then, we need to attach USB devices from Windows using **Windows PowerShell** to virtual Linux environment.
Type `usbipd list` with output the following result, find **busid** for which device named "HDC Device".

```bash
Connected:
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
1-2    24ae:185a  USB Input Device                                              Not shared
1-8    174f:2435  Integrated Camera                                             Not shared
1-9    06cb:00bd  Synaptics UWP WBDI                                            Not shared
1-14   8087:0029  Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)                                Not shared
1-17   2207:5000  "HDC Device"                                                  Shared
```

In our case, we need take **busid** `1-17`.
!!! note
    If the status of **HDC Device** is **Not shared**, type `usbipd bind --busid 1-17`, in above case the device **busid** is 1-17, change it to adjust your case if necessary.

    After re-running command `usbipd list`, you will find the device status changed into `Shared`.

Then we need to attach the device to wsl using command `usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-17`, the output should be like the following, wait until attach process finishes:

```bash
usbipd: info: Using WSL distribution 'Ubuntu' to attach; the device will be available in all WSL 2 distributions.
usbipd: info: Detected networking mode 'nat'.
usbipd: info: Using IP address 172.24.144.1 to reach the host.
```

!!! note
    If you are not sure about if the device had been attached already, detach it first using command `usbipd detach --busid 1-17`


After this setup, running `flash/flash.py -q` should produce the following output, indicating readiness:

```bash
maskrom
```

!!! note
    If the output is `none`, try to re-run **detach** and **attach** procedures above, you can also check your device connection details using `dmesg | tail -n 50` command on **WSL**.

    If still not working, try to change a cable, switch to connect another port on your PC or keep your board screen unlocked.




To enable *programming mode* on the device, perform the following steps:

 1. Press and hold `VOL/RECOVERY` then `RESET` buttons.
 2. Release `RESET` button.

When you run `flash/flash.py -q` again, the output is `none` because the device's USB identity has changed.

Open **Windows PowerShell** again and type `usbipd list`, the output will be like the following:
```bash
Connected:
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
1-1    24ae:185a  USB Input Device                                              Not shared
1-2    2207:350a  USB download gadget                                           Not shared
1-8    174f:2435  Integrated Camera                                             Not shared
1-9    06cb:00bd  Synaptics UWP WBDI                                            Not shared
1-14   8087:0029  Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)                                Not shared
```

Find the **busid** for device which named 'USB download gadget', in our case it is `1-2`.
Bind it first `usbipd bind --busid 1-2`, it requires to run the `Windows PowerShell` as administrator.

Then attach it to **WSL**, run `usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-2`.

After that, switch to **WSL** and run `flash/flash.py -q` again you will find the output is `loader`, which means the device is under development mode now.

Once the above steps are completed successfully, you can proceed to flash the board:

```bash
flash/flash.py -a -i ./out/rk3568/packages/phone/images
```

#### Connecting to serial console

To read the serial output, ensure the board is correctly connected and powered on. The default baud rate for the HH-SCDAYU200 board is 1500000. You can use minicom or a similar serial terminal:

```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000
```
